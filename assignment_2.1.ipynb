    "You have been hired by ChessChowDown Inc. to provide insights on chess games played in the Lichess portal. Your insights will be used by the company to develop new learning materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a dataset of chess games played on the Lichess website (lichess.org), each game document has the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **event**: Type of event the game was played \n",
    "* **site**: Where the game was played \n",
    "* **date**: date the game was played\n",
    "* **UTCdate** : date in UTC format\n",
    "* **UTCtime**: time the game was played in UTC format\n",
    "* **White**: username of the White player\n",
    "* **Black**: username of the Black player\n",
    "* **ECO**: Alphanumeric code of the opening played in the game\n",
    "* **opening**: Name of the opening played in the game\n",
    "* **TimeControl**: Time control the game was played, e.g, 60 + 0 seconds per move increment or 5min + 3 seconds per increment\n",
    "* **result**: result of the game\n",
    "* **WhiteElo**: Elo rating of the White player at the time of the game (https://www.chess.com/terms/elo-rating-chess)\n",
    "* **BlackElo**: Elo rating of the Black player at the time of the game\n",
    "* **moves**: list of moves of the game, each move is a sub-document with the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **number**: Number of the move\n",
    "    * **turn**: false if it was White move, true if it was Black move. Note that it is important to consider move number together with the turn: one can have move = 1 and turn = False (White's first move) and move = 1 and turn = True (Black's first move)\n",
    "    * **clock**: player’s remaining time to the next time control after this move, in seconds\n",
    "    * **move**: the algebraic notation of the move https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess) \n",
    "\n",
    "    * **eval**: A subdocument with the evaluation of the position after the move calculated by a computer chess engine: \n",
    "  {'unit' : centipawns or mate , 'value' : an integer}. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  If unit is 'centipawns', then 'value' is an integer that quantifies the advantage/disadvantage in the position after the move, from the point of view of the White player. A positive value indicates White player has a better position, a negative value indicates Black has a better position. \n",
    "  If unit is 'mate', then 'value' is the number of moves until checkmate. A positive value indicates that White player can checkmate in 'value' moves, a negative value, that Black player can checkmate in 'value' moves. \n",
    "  As checkmate ends the game, a mate evaluation indicates a very large advantage.\n"

After some discussion, the team decides that a metric to select potentially wrongly evaluated games is a high variance in centipawn evaluations (ignoring checkmate evaluations).\n",
